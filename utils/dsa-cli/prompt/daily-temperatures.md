### Description

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

### Example 1

```bash
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
```

### Example 2

```bash
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
```

### Constraints:

-     1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
-     30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100
