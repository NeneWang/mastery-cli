### Description

Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

### Example 1

```bash
Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/btree.jpg)

```bash
Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation: [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
