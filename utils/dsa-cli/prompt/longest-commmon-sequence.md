### Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest **strictly increasing subsequence**.

 

### Example 1

```bash
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

### Example 2

```bash
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

### Example 3

```bash
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```


### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
