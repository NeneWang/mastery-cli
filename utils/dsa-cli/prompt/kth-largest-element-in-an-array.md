### Description

Given an integer array nums and an integer `k`, return the `kth` largest element in the array.

Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.

You must solve it in `O(n)` time complexity.

### Example 1

```bash
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
```

### Example 2

```bash
Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5 
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
