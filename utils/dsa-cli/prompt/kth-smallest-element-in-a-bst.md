### Description

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

### Example 1

```bash
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

### Example 2

```bash
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is n.
- 1 <= k <= n <= 104
- 0 <= Node.val <= 104
