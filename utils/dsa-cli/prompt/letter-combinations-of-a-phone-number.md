### Description

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in **any order**.
A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

### Example 1

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/15/1200px-telephone-keypad2svg.png)


```bash
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
```

### Example 2

```bash
Input: digits = ""
Output: []
```

### Example 3

```bash
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
```


### Constraints:

- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9']
